#Function that populates the Contact page
#This function: 
# 1. Checks that this is a post request
# 2. A reference to the form is obtained and stored in the variable form
# 3. The form is tested to ensure the values entered are valid.
# 4. The form values are obtained using form.cleaned data and stored in the cd variable
# 5. A new ContactTable object, defined in the models.py file is created and itâ€™s attributes are populated using the values from the form.
# 6. The save method of the object is called.
# All this is done because save() function only applies to model forms.
